MIDDLEWARE: 
  - Middleware is something that comes in between the request and response
  - this is actually clearly explained in the example code
  - visit the webpage "writing middleware for use in express apps"
  - we can declare our middleware and can use it in any route by using
   "app.use(middleware)" command (This is for express)
